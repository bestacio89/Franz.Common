# Sample Implementations

The Franz.Common repository does not embed full microservices in order to maintain clean separation between:

- framework APIs and behaviors
- application templates
- concrete reference implementations

For a complete, ready-to-deploy sample microservice using Franz.Common, see:

👉 **Franz API Template**  
URL: https://github.com/bestacio89/Franz

This template demonstrates:

- HTTP pipelines  
- CQRS handlers  
- validation  
- logging + correlation  
- DI and module organization  
- structured folder conventions  
- resilience patterns  
- telemetry setup  

It is the canonical reference implementation for Franz.Common–based services.
