Below is an example of how you might transform the existing structure into a more polished and comprehensive README for **Franz.Common** and its sub-repositories related to Kafka microservices. You can adapt details such as installation steps, commands, or specific repository references as needed for your actual setup.

# Franz.Common

**Franz.Common** is a lightweight, modular framework designed to streamline the development and maintenance of **Kafka-based microservices**. It provides common abstractions, utilities, and patterns that make building reliable, scalable, and maintainable event-driven systems simpler and more consistent across projects.

## Introduction
**Franz.Common** was born out of a need to reduce boilerplate and complexity when working with [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) in microservices architectures. The project’s primary objective is to:

- Provide **common abstractions** for Kafka producers and consumers.
- Offer **shared utilities** for message serialization, logging, retries, and error handling.
- Enable a **consistent developer experience** across different microservices.

Whether you’re creating a new microservice from scratch or adding Kafka support to an existing system, **Franz.Common** aims to simplify your development process by offering well-tested building blocks and patterns.

## Getting Started

### Installation
Installation approaches differ based on your language and environment. For a typical .NET environment, you can include **Franz.Common** via NuGet:

```bash
# Using the dotnet CLI
dotnet add package Franz.Common --version <latest_version>
```

If you’re using **npm**, **Maven**, or another package manager for a language wrapper, please see [API References](#api-references) for additional instructions.

### Software Dependencies
- **.NET 6+** (if your implementations are in C#)
- **Kafka** 2.6+ (although older versions may still work)
- **Confluent.Kafka** client library (or any Kafka client library your environment supports)
- **Docker** (optional) for containerized local development and testing

### Latest Releases
Check the [Releases](https://github.com/your-org/franz.common/releases) section in this repository (or your organization's package manager registry) for information about:
- **Release notes**
- **New features** and **breaking changes**
- **Beta or pre-release packages** for upcoming features

### API References
Detailed API documentation is available here:
- **Online Docs**: [Franz.Common Documentation](https://github.com/your-org/franz.common/wiki)  
- **Generated Docs**: If you clone the repository, you can generate local API docs by running:

  ```bash
  dotnet build
  # Additional script or command to generate documentation if applicable
  ```

## Sub-Repositories
Franz.Common is part of a suite of repositories that collectively provide full coverage for Kafka-based microservices:

1. **Franz.Producer**  
   Handles message production with built-in batching, serialization, and retry mechanisms.

2. **Franz.Consumer**  
   Simplifies consumer group management, message handling, and parallel processing strategies.

3. **Franz.Utils**  
   Provides shared utility classes, logging integrations, serialization/deserialization helpers, and custom middleware.

4. **Franz.Sample** (Optional)  
   A sample microservice or sandbox project showcasing how to integrate **Franz.Common** (and other sub-repos) in a real-world scenario.

Each sub-repository complements **Franz.Common** by focusing on specialized functionalities. You can find them under the [Franz](https://github.com/your-org?tab=repositories) GitHub organization (or wherever your sub-repos reside).

## Build and Test

### Build
1. **Clone** this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/franz.common.git
   cd franz.common
   ```
2. **Build** the solution (for .NET example):
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

### Test
**Unit Tests**:  
```bash
dotnet test
```
This command will discover and run all test projects. Ensure Kafka-related integration tests are configured to run locally or in a CI/CD environment that has access to Kafka brokers.  

**Integration Tests** (if applicable):  
- Spin up Kafka locally using Docker or your preferred environment:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```
- Run the integration test suite:
  ```bash
  dotnet test --filter Category=Integration
  ```
