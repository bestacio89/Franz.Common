### Version 1.3.1

* **Multi-Tenancy Enhancements**

  * Added `TenantResolutionSource.Property` for message property‚Äìbased resolution.
  * Refactored all HTTP resolvers to use canonical models.
  * Refactored all Messaging resolvers to resolve against `TenantInfo` via `ITenantStore`.

  * Initial release of **Franz.Common.Mediator**.
  * Core Dispatcher, Commands, Queries, Notifications.
  * Basic Pipelines (Logging, Validation).
  * EF integration with `DbContextBase`.
  * Added Observability hooks (`MediatorContext`, `IMediatorObserver`).
  * Console observer provided for testing/demo.
  * Support for optional telemetry (tracing/correlation).

* **Diagnostics**
  * Structured results for better logging and observability.

* **Consistency**
  * HTTP and Messaging now share the same contracts and patterns.

---

### Version 1.3.2
* Introduced **Error abstraction** with `Error` class and standard codes (`NotFound`, `Validation`, `Conflict`, `Unexpected`).
* Extended `Result<T>` to integrate seamlessly with `Error`.
* Added `ResultExtensions` for ergonomic `.ToFailure<T>()` and `.ToResult()` conversions.

---

### Version 1.3.3
* Refined **Validation pipeline** with FluentValidation adapter.
* Improved **Transaction pipeline** with options support (rollback rules).
* Bugfixes: ensured **streaming dispatcher yields** with observability.

---

### Version 1.3.4
* üî• Removed **AutoMapper coupling** from the framework.
* Responsibility for object mapping now belongs to the **Application layer**.
* Framework remains reflection-free and adapter-friendly.
* Cleaner separation of concerns, lighter dependencies, more flexible.

###  Version 1.3.5
* Fixed open generic pipeline registration (no more object,object hack).
* Transaction & caching pipelines now DI-friendly with proper constructors.
* Resilience pipelines (Retry, Timeout, CircuitBreaker, Bulkhead) fully configurable via FranzMediatorOptions.
* README updated with pipeline usage and configuration examples.
* Smoother onboarding: one-line AddFranzMediator() setup with options delegate.

###  Franz.Common v1.3.6
üîπ Mediator Core

Removed MediatR dependency completely.

All notifications and handlers now use Franz.Mediator (INotification, INotificationHandler<>, IDispatcher).

IIntegrationEvent now inherits from INotification ‚Üí seamless pipeline + messaging integration.

üîπ Messaging (Kafka)

MessagingPublisher updated:

Now uses _dispatcher.PublishAsync() to process integration events through mediator pipelines before publishing to Kafka.

Publish method signature changed from void ‚Üí Task for proper async/await handling.

MessagingInitializer updated:

Scans for Franz.Mediator.Handlers.INotificationHandler<> instead of MediatR handlers.

Detects all event types implementing IIntegrationEvent and ensures topics are initialized accordingly.

Dead-letter & subscription topics creation logic streamlined with Franz‚Äôs naming conventions (ExchangeNamer, HeaderNamer).

üîπ Dependency Injection

All DI extensions isolated into Franz.Common.DependencyInjection.Extensions.

MS.DI is now just an adapter ‚Äî core libraries are DI-free.

Clear separation: Franz works without DI, adapters exist for convenience.

üîπ Framework Integrity

Minimal rewiring outside of DI + Messaging:

Only 3 main classes required changes (MessagingPublisher, MessagingInitializer, DI extensions).

All domain events, pipelines, processors, and observers remain unchanged ‚Äî proving Franz‚Äôs abstractions were clean.

### v1.3.9 ‚Äì Database Stability Fixes

Fixed incorrect default port fallback (3308 ‚Üí now correct defaults per provider: MariaDB 3306, Postgres 5432, SQL Server 1433, Oracle 1521).

Connection string builder now uses 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost to avoid socket/TCP mismatches.

Proper SslMode=None applied by default to avoid unwanted SSL negotiation failures.

Masked passwords in logs for safe diagnostics.

### v1.3.10 ‚Äì Scoped DbContext & Lifecycle

Enforced DbContext resolution through DI scope, preventing ‚Äúphantom DB‚Äù issues.

Corrected EnsureCreated vs Migrate lifecycle usage:

Dev/Test ‚Üí EnsureDeleted + EnsureCreated

Prod ‚Üí Migrate() only

Added options to configure drop/create/migrate behavior via DatabaseOptions.

### v1.3.11 ‚Äì Seed & Lifecycle Cleanup

Fixed duplicate seed issues caused by mixing EnsureCreated + Migrate.

Clarified seeding strategy:

Use HasData only once (migrations path).

For dev/test, prefer manual or conditional seeding.

Introduced environment-aware DB lifecycle defaults (no more accidental reseeds).

### v1.3.12 ‚Äì Verbose Logging & Observability

Added LoggingPreProcessor and LoggingPostProcessor with runtime request type detection.

Prefixed logs with [Command], [Query], [Request] for clear business-level observability.

Unified logging across pipelines ‚Üí no more generic ICommand\1orIQuery`1` names.

Lightweight verbose logs:

Pre ‚Üí Pipeline ‚Üí Post lifecycle traced with request names.

Keeps focus on Commands/Queries, not raw SQL noise.

### v1.3.14 Correlaiton Id enhancements

Unified correlation pipeline ‚Äî correlation IDs now flow consistently across requests, notifications, and mediator pipelines.

Automatic propagation ‚Äî every log entry (request, DB query, notification, response) carries the same correlation ID.

External ID support ‚Äî accepts incoming X-Correlation-ID headers for distributed tracing across services.

Centralized handling ‚Äî correlation ID logic moved into Franz.Common.Logging for reuse and consistency.

Scoped logging ‚Äî integrated with ILogger.BeginScope and Serilog‚Äôs LogContext to enrich all logs automatically.

Environment-aware output ‚Äî detailed payload logs in development, structured correlation-focused logs in production.
