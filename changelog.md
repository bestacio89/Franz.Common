## Version 1.6.17 – Messaging Orchestration & Consistency Update 🧩

A unified release focusing on **messaging layer alignment**, **naming consistency**, and **protocol extensibility** across **Kafka**, **RabbitMQ**, and **HTTP-based messaging** integrations.

---

### ☕ **Franz.Common.Messaging.Kafka**

✅ **Extension Method Rebrand for Uniformity & Intent Clarity**
All Kafka registration extensions were renamed to follow the **explicit `AddKafka*` convention**, ensuring every API call clearly indicates its messaging backend.

**Updated method list:**
`AddKafkaMessaging()` • `AddKafkaMessagingPublisher()` • `AddKafkaMessagingSender()` • `AddKafkaMessagingConsumer()` • `AddKafkaMessagingConfiguration()`

🧠 **Purpose:**
To standardize naming across all Franz messaging providers and make intent instantly recognizable in dependency registration blocks.

---

### 🐇 **Franz.Common.Http.Messaging**

* Added **RabbitMQ messaging integration** with dedicated health checks and scoped transaction filters.
* Introduced **`MessagingTransactionFilter`** (replacing `TransactionFilter`) for consistent commit/rollback behavior across messaging operations.
* Implemented **unified registration** via `AddMessagingInHttpContext()` for both Kafka and RabbitMQ providers.
* Improved **health check registration** to automatically avoid duplicate service entries.
* Aligned with Kafka’s **API naming convention** for consistency (`AddKafkaMessaging*`).
* Established **version synchronization** across all Franz messaging packages (`Kafka`, `RabbitMQ`, `AzureEventBus`).

---

### 🔧 Global Notes

* Messaging layer now adheres to **protocol-specific clarity** (`Kafka`, `RabbitMQ`, `AzureEventBus`).
* Improves maintainability and onboarding clarity across all Franz microservice templates.
* Paves the way for **Franz 1.7.x** modular expansion and telemetry standardization.

---

> 🧭 **Note:**
> This changelog is intentionally detailed — serving both as a **learning artifact** for junior developers and an **audit trail** for Franz ecosystem evolution.
> Each entry reflects design reasoning, dependency evolution, and architectural refinements across the entire framework.

## Version 1.6.18 - Mapping Refinements

### 🧠 **Constructor-Aware Mapping Engine**

* Detects and invokes **record positional constructors** automatically.
* Eliminates the need for `public MemberDto() { }`.
* Allows **immutable DTOs and record structs** out-of-the-box.
* Falls back to `Activator.CreateInstance()` only when no usable constructor exists.
* 100 % backward-compatible with `ConstructUsing()` and legacy mappings.

### 🧩 **Architectural Impact**

* Strengthens immutability and contract integrity in the Franz ecosystem.
* Enables the “DTOs must be immutable” Tribunal rule to pass naturally.
* Outperforms AutoMapper in instantiation efficiency and architectural compliance.
